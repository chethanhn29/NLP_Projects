# [Spam Detection Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chethuhn/nlp-beginner-text-to-vector-using-word2vec-3)

## Overview

This project involved the development of a robust spam detection system. We utilized a diverse set of methods and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to filter out unwanted spam messages while ensuring genuine communication remains unaffected.

## Key Highlights

1. **Feature Extraction Variety:**
   - Word2Vec Embeddings: Captured semantic relationships among words.
   - Transformers (e.g., BERT): Extracted contextual embeddings.
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Analyzed term importance and frequency.
   - Bag of Words (BoW): Utilized traditional word occurrence-based features.

2. **NLP Techniques for Text Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization: Split text into tokens for granular analysis.
   - Stopword Removal: Eliminated common stopwords to focus on meaningful content.
   - Stemming and Lemmatization: Standardized word forms.
   - Special Character Handling: Ensured robustness by addressing non-standard text patterns.
   - Normalization: Maintained uniform text formatting.

## Results

The integration of these methods and NLP techniques yielded an exceptional spam detection system. It effectively distinguishes spam from legitimate content, providing users with a secure and seamless communication experience.

This project showcases expertise in NLP and the ability to develop practical solutions for improving user experiences and data security.
